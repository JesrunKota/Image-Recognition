## 🧪 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10)
   - Normalize pixel values
   - Split into training and test sets

2. **CNN Architecture**
   - Multiple Conv2D + MaxPooling2D layers
   - Flatten + Dense layers
   - Softmax output for classification

3. **Training**
   - Categorical Crossentropy loss
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Epochs: 20–50

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
   - Visualization of training history

## 📈 Sample Results

- **Training Accuracy:** ~95%
- **Test Accuracy:** ~80% (on CIFAR-10)
- **Example Output:** Correctly classified sample images
